We can say that “safe and “secure” are the words that come to mind when speaking about web3 wallets. 
Concerns regarding security are a primary thought when it comes to web3 systems, and that's why smart contracts play a significan role in every Dapp. These allow to mitigate the risks brought upon by bad actors and assure the safety of your funds.

There are several projects in the ecosystem that already implement great Multi-sig wallets, that can be super reliable when talking about others stealing your funds.

The objective with this project, is to try to build a Multi-sig wallet with my knowledge, and experience new features, that other wallets on Ethereum may not have.
