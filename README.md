This paper introduces **Spades**: an open source multisig wallet.

Like a regular crypto wallet, **Spades** is a smart contract, that uses multisignature as its core feature. Users that deploy this contract, can chose how many owners/signatures will be required, thus making the wallet much more difficult to hack because of multiple private keys.

This provides an added layer of security, as it ensures that no single person can unilaterally access or transfer the funds.

In addition to its multisignature functionality, this particular wallet also features a lock feature that allows users to prevent transactions from being executed until they are ready or not revoked by an owner. This feature can be especially useful for businesses or individuals who need time to review and verify transactions before they are fully executed.

When activated, the lock feature essentially puts a hold on any pending transactions (already signed) until they are manually released by a time frame. This helps to prevent accidental or unauthorized transfers and gives users greater control over their funds.

Overall, this combination of multisignature security and transaction locking makes this wallet an ideal choice for those looking for enhanced protection and flexibility when managing their crypto holdings.
