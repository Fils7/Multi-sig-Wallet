We can say that “safe and “secure” are the words that come to mind when speaking about web3 wallets. Concerns regarding security are a primary thought in the field of web3 systems. These allow to mitigate the risks brought upon by bad actors and assure the safety of your funds. 

There are several projects in the ecosystem that already implement such “systems” that can be super reliable when talking about others stealing your funds.

When it comes to having several private keys to sign or allow transactions, it will mitigate the risk of having a bad actor with one of the private keys, and move all your funds.

**Points of Interest:**

- *More than one private key to authorize crypto transaction;*
- *Limit of what one private key can transact each day;*
- ***3 day timeframe for a transaction to be executed;***

The new feature of a **timeframe to cancel a transaction**, will be the key point of this wallet. Even if one compromised private key can move up to 10% of the balance, this time frame will give the opportunity for an owner to realize that this key has been compromised, thus, giving him time to cancel this transaction.

The system would work, if some how there is a lock() system after the request for the transaction and before its been executed. Instead of executing instantly, it would only be executed after a time frame,  if non of the owners  refuse it.
